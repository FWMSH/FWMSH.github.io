  '1': "Atlanta native Erika Anderson is a self-proclaimed education enthusiast who graduated with honors with Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering from Spelman College and Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively. While progressing through her college studies, Erika worked as a math tutor and teacher’s assistant, served as the Academic Excellence chair on the National Society of Black Engineers’ executive board, and performed biostatics research modeling cellular aging. Not only was she active on campus during the school year, she spent her summers gaining real industry experience, doing things like analyzing stress/strain data for liquid hydrogen tanks at NASA, performing flight data analysis on plane engines at GE Aviation, and calculating the probability of failure for heat exchangers at ExxonMobil. It was this experience that ultimately landed her a full-time job at ExxonMobil, the company for which she has now worked for the last 5 years. Being a Mechanical Engineer at ExxonMobil’s refinery in Beaumont, Texas presented plenty of opportunities to grow her technical and leadership skills. As a Fixed Equipment Strategy Facilitator, she led a cross functional team of Mechanical and Chemical Engineers, Unit Inspectors, and Process Operators to perform risk assessments on refinery equipment to identify and mitigate potential equipment failures. From small 2 inch pipe lines to 60 feet tall distillation towers and every type of process equipment in between, Erika’s team ensures that this refinery equipment is fit for service and able to safely refine crude oil to produce end products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, waxes, asphalt and even plastic! As a result of her performance in that role, Erika was recently relocated to ExxonMobil’s Houston headquarters to join their Research and Engineering group as a Reliability Engineer. She now applies her refinery experience and technical expertise to provide engineering support to ExxonMobil’s refineries and chemical plants all across the globe!<p>In addition to her engineering role, she has also had the pleasure of fulfilling her passion for service by serving as the Community Outreach Chair of ExxonMobil’s Black Employee Success Team. In this role, she coordinates several of the company’s volunteer initiatives such as math tutoring at a local middle school and leading STEM design challenges for students in the Texas Alliance for Minorities in Engineering program (TAME). Inspired by a passion for education and love of music, Erika recently founded her own organization, The Math Lab, which offers an engaging alternative to traditional classroom and online teaching by presenting math lessons through a seamless combination of music and curriculum-based mathematics. In fact, The Math Lab is the brain child of she and her late husband, Wick Anderson. Even though he is no longer physically here to share in its success, Erika takes pride in knowing that she is cultivating the seeds they planted together by furthering their mission to prepare scholars for academic success.",

  '2': "Atlanta, Texas -- A talented student, Bessie Coleman quickly realized she yearned for an advanced education. In 1910, when Coleman was only 18 years old, she took all of the money she had saved to enroll in the \"Colored Agricultural and Normal University\" in Langston, Oklahoma. In 1915, Coleman moved to Chicago to live with her brother, who had served in the military in WWI. Her brother inspired her to become a pilot after he recounted stories of French female pilots he saw while stationed in France. In 1919, Coleman moved to France to seek out a flying instructor, realizing no one in the United States would be willing to teach her. After she returned, Coleman performed flight shows for curious audiences, and in 1925, Coleman put a down payment on a Jenny-JN-4 with an OX-5 engine at Dallas Love Field Airport. In 1926, during a test flight with her mechanic, the plane malfunctioned, tragically ending Coleman's life at the young age of 34. Her legacy lived on. After her death, the Bessie Coleman Aero Club (1929) and the Bessie Coleman Aviators Club (1977) used her namesake to honor her flying career. In 1995, the United States Postal Service issue a stamp, commemorating her accomplishments.",

After getting married, Gipson and her husband, Reverend Franklin Gipson, moved to Fort Worth in 1872. Little is known of her early years, but records show that in 1903, Gipson entered the Chautauqua School of Nursing Correspondence School based out of Jamestown, New York.<p>In 1907 Gipson graduated the Chautauqua School of Nursing and was awarded her nursing certificate at the age of 53. Gipson became the first black graduate of an accredited nursing school to work in the South. After earning her degree, Gipson became involved in the Texas Graduate Nurses Association and helped lobby the Texas legislature to standardize the requirements for nursing.<p>Gipson worked throughout her life to desegregate the field of nursing. She was a founder of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, and, in 1948, Gipson’s work helped lead to the integration of the American Nurses’ Association.
