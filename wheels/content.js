      '1': "In 1863, Mr. Henry Ford was born on his family's farm outside Detroit, Michigan. Early on, he showed interest in mechanics and began working at age 16 for the Michigan Car Company, eventually landing a machinist apprenticeship at another company. His interests only increased when he started learning mechanical engineering and how gasoline engines work. Ford began several models; literally \"A\" through \"S\" before landing on the most well-known \"Model T\" version produced by the Ford Motor Company from 1908 through 1927. Regarded as the first affordable car for the everyday man, it would make traveling more accessible to people, allowing them to cover a larger distance within a shorter time frame.",
      '2': "\"Carretto Siciliano,\" or Sicilian cart, is a handmade, wooden cart that is elaborately decorated with depictions of Sicily's rich folklore. These carts were often on the smaller side, designed for a single mule or horse. They started being used in the early nineteenth century and reached the peak of their popularity by the 1920s. The carts were geared towards carrying smaller loads across Sicily's rocky terrain.<p>The craftsmanship of these carts were passed down from generation to generation and each province in Sicily has a distinct style of cart that they are known for. Using wood and metal to create the intricate details on the cart, the imagery often portrays different periods of Italian history. Even the animal would often have an elaborate harness adorned with colorful ribbons, feathers, and tassels. Nowadays, these beautiful carts are only seen during festive occasions and are no longer used for utilitarian purposes.",
      '3': "These homemade cars were originally built from scrap pieces of wood, such as a wooden soap box—hence how they got their name. Eventually, youths started using other materials for their cars as the sport evolved. The derby's history comes out of America's Great Depression, drawing inspiration from both downhill sledding and auto racing. What began in Ohio, quickly became a nationwide racing circuit where kids could compete at a local or regional level. By the mid 1930s, those regional winners would qualify to attend the annual Derby race in Akron, Ohio.",
      '4': 'The origins of who invented pedicabs or "rickshaws" are not completely known, but it is believed to be a Western design or concept. There are a few possible men attributed to the invention, however, these small wagons begin popping up in Asia around the mid-1800s. They become very popular as a quick form of inner-city transportation. Earlier models needed manpower, literally: runners were needed to pull the carts by hand. Later on, bicycles would be fitted to the carts, making it easier on the drivers.',
