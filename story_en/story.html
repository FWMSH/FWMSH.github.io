The largest city in ancient Mexico was Teotihuacan, about an hour drive north of Mexico City, with about 200,000 residents. The city had broad, elegant boulevards (The Avenue of the Dead), walled compounds and giant pyramids. From about AD 300-AD 600, Teotihuacan was also the most powerful city in the ancient world, being involved with both Maya and Zapotec politics and economies. Teotihuacan includes Maya and Zapotec neighborhoods where trade relationships brought people who became permanent residents, which would have been similar to China town today.
Teotihuacan is also where the feathered-serpent motif seems to have originated. In the Ciudadela, a great walled compound that could hold 10,000 people, pyramids with feather-serpent motifs and featured.  This motif and its associated religious tradition spread throughout Mexico and Central America and was ultimately appropriated by the Aztecs and is, today, on the Mexican flag.
